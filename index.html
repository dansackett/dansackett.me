          I'm a software engineer living in Central Florida with my wife and
          daughter. I have a soft spot for Python and ReactJS and I'm lucky
          enough to do both of those things with <a class="link dim red" href="https://zoomforth.com">Zoomforth</a>.

              Writing Suggestions takes a userâ€™s writing either via upload or
              pasting and parses it to find common pitfalls that writers make.
              It highlights these words and phrases for the user to make
              logical decisions.

              Protected Message was a weekend project I built because I was
              paranoid about sending private data to family members. It
              encrypts messages for 30 minutes which can be obtained by a
              trusted recipient.

              Program everyday was my personal blog I ran for a year up until
              my daughter was born. I wrote about programming concepts,
              computer science principles, and mostly Python. I still write
              here from time to time as I learn more.

              I felt my computer science background was lacking so in my spare
              time I have attempted to catch up on relevant algorithms and data
              structures using the Golang. Each topic has detailed explanations
              about concepts.

            <p class="lh-copy">
              Ellie is a distributed task queue written in Golang. It is a
              basic implementation based loosely on the Celery API and was an
              experiment in what I could accomplish using Goroutines and the
              standard library.

            <p class="lh-copy">
              Todooo is a simple CLI-based application which acts like a REPL
              for managing todo lists. It is written in Python and has a basic
              API which uses simple text files as the backend for loading and
              managing lists.
